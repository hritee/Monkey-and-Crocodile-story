Once upon a time, there lived a monkey who recided on a Jamun tree, which was on a bank of a river.
In the river there lived a crocodile and his wife.
One day the crocodile came to the bank of the river and rested under the tree, the kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits
next day the crocodile came back to have more fruit as he loved them.
As days passed by the crocodile and the monkey became good friends.....
